## Simple Steps ðŸŽ‚ 

We are unveiling the secrets of a Python program that uses binary encoding to decipher birthdays, the code snippet you see below does just that. 

It takes you through a set of five questions, each narrowing down the possible birthdate until it finally reveals the day of the month.

### Complete code

The provided Python code snippet takes you on a journey through a sequence of questions, each designed to narrow down the potential birthdate.

```python
day = 0 # birth day to be determined 

# Prompt the user to answer the first question
question1 = \
"""
Is your birthday in Set1

  1  3  5  7
  9 11 13 15
 17 19 21 23
 25 27 29 31

 Enter 0 for No and 1 for Yes: 
""" 
answer = eval(input(question1 + ' >> '))

if answer == 1:
    day += 1
    
# Prompt the user to answer the second question
question2 = \
"""
Is your birthday in Set2

  2  3  6  7
 10 11 14 15
 18 19 22 23
 26 27 30 31

 Enter 0 for No and 1 for Yes:
""" 
answer2 = eval(input(question2 + ' >> '))

if answer2 == 1:
    day += 2

#Prompt the user to answer the third question
question3 = \
"""
 Is your birthday in Set3
 
 4  5  6  7
 12 13 14 15
 20 21 22 23
 28 29 30 31

 Enter 0 for No and 1 for Yes: 
"""
answer3 = eval(input(question3 + ' >> '))

if answer3 == 1:
    day += 4
    
#Prompt the user to answer the fourth question
question4 = \
"""
 Is your birthday in Set4
 
 8  9  10 11
 12 13 14 15
 24 25 26 27
 28 29 30 31
 
 Enter 0 for No and 1 for Yes: 
"""
answer4 = eval(input(question4 + ' >> '))

if answer4 == 1:
    day += 8
    
#Prompt the user to answer the last question
question5 = \
"""
Is your birthday in Set5

 16 17 18 19
 20 21 22 23
 24 25 26 27
 28 29 30 31
 
 Enter 0 for No and 1 for Yes: 
"""
answer5 = eval(input(question5 + ' >> '))

if answer5 == 1:
    day += 16

print("\nYour birthday is on " + str(day) + "!") #displayng result!

```

Let's break down how this mysterious code works step by step:

##### Step 1: The Setup

- We begin by initializing a variable called `day` to `0`, representing an undetermined birthdate. The code then presents the first question, question1, asking if the birthdate falls within "`Set1`." Users respond with either `0` for "No" or `1` for "Yes."

##### Step 2: Enter Binary Decoding

- When a user responds "Yes" to the first question, the program adds `1` to the `day` variable. This may seem arbitrary, but _it's the essence of binary decoding_ in action. 

Each question corresponds to a specific binary digit, and answering "Yes" sets that digit to 1.

##### Step 3: Journey Through the Sets

- The program continues by asking a series of questions, moving through "Set2," "Set3," "Set4," and finally "Set5." For each "Yes" answer, the day variable is incremented by a __power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, respectively)__. 

This binary representation ingeniously ensures that every day of the month has a unique combination of "Yes" and "No" answers.


##### Step 4: The Grand Revelation
- After the fifth question, the program performs a binary calculation to decode the birthdate's day of the month. The result is displayed in decimal form, unveiling the birthdate with precision. It's like solving a digital puzzle!
